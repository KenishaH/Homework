<h2 class = "Rules on the Playground ">Rules to follow</h2>
<p><b> Adults who supervise children's use of playground equipment can help prevent injuries. If a child is hurt, an adult can assist them and provide any immediate first aid that may be required.
  On the playground, children should always be supervised by an adult. Watch out for small children, as they may not be able to judge distance or anticipate risky circumstances. On the playground, older children often push themselves, so it's critical that an adult supervises them.
